# Car_Crashing_game

A web-based entertainment project was developed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. In this project, 
the user controls a car that is constantly running on a three-way road. The goal of the game is for the user to 
avoid crashing into the computer's car as he can move his car in different direction. The user gets points for 
passing cars, and the game ends when the user's car crashes into the computer's car.
